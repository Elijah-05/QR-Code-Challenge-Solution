## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt alot of things, when trying to make my solution more accurate to the given design. So I recommend others to try to be more accurate(not Perfect) as the design this makes them to learn more even by themselve.

### Continued development

I am comfortable with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. So I will try this same challenge with React, since it is component it is great with React.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for reffering some css rules reason. w3school is nice for getting more refference to remember.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google.com) - And this is the main helper for almost everything, it is easier to directly search on google rather than specific code element search.
